"""Price transforms: single prices that summarise each candle.

Each method fetches the instrument's candles through `prices`, adds one or more TA-Lib columns and returns the candles. The class is inherited by `tradingmachine.assets.instruments.Instrument`, which supplies `prices`.

Typical usage example:

  infosys = instruments.Instrument(exchange="nse", segment="equities", symbol="INFY")
  frame = infosys.typical_price(days=30)

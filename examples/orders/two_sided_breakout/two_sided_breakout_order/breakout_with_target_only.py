"""Preview and rest stop entries 6% either side of the market, with only a target to arm after a break.

The program previews, then places, a two-sided breakout on one Vodafone Idea share: a native buy stop 6% above the market and a native sell stop 6% below it, where the first to fill cancels the other. Its only exit is a target 4% of the price beyond the fill, so there is no stop distance and no stop limit offset. Neither entry can be reached in the seconds the order lives; the program prints the parent and both stops at the broker and cancels them.

Typical usage example:

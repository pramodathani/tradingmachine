"""Rest a buy that would scale out through three targets, then cancel it.

The program rests a limit buy of three Vodafone Idea shares 3% below the market. Once it filled, UBI would rest three limit sells of one share each at 3%, 4% and 5% above the market, and a stop-limit sell triggering 5% below the market that moves to the average entry price after the first target fills. A scale-out needs at least two targets, and three shares give each target one. The entry does not fill in the seconds it rests, so no exit is ever sent; the program prints the parent and the broker order and then cancels the parent. It passes `hold_limits=False`, so UBI sends the order to the broker at once instead of holding it until the market reaches its price.

Typical usage example:

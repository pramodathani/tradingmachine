"""Overlap studies: moving averages, bands and other indicators drawn on the price scale.

Each method fetches the instrument's candles through `prices`, adds one or more TA-Lib columns and returns the candles. The class is inherited by `assets.instruments.Instrument`, which supplies `prices`.

Typical usage example:

  infosys = instruments.Instrument(exchange="nse", segment="equities", symbol="INFY")
  frame = infosys.simple_moving_average(window=20, days=365)
